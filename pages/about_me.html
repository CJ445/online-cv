        <h2>A look back...</h2>
        <p>
            I have always been fascinated by technology, even as a young child. Naturally, the first time I used a computer was when I borrowed my mother's phone. Even before I learned how to play any games, I used to simply press the buttons to see what they did.
            <br><br>This quickly evolved into my favorite pastime. My investigation would start as soon as I was able to utilize a different type of phone in the future. Even while I might get sidetracked by searching for games on the phones initially, as soon as I realized there weren't any, I would immediately begin examining all of the options and features of a new phone.
            <br><br> My passion for technology persisted as I grew older. One of my favorite memories from school is discovering new and complex ways to complete a project that even somewhat involved the usage of a computer. I first learned about Python while I was in the eighth grade. I discovered it on YouTube and immediately started experimenting with all the wonderful things it might be used for, such as creating various shapes and figures with Python Turtle and other things. 
            <br><br>In the early years of my adolescence, I developed into the family member whom everyone turned to for help with technology. I demonstrated how to send a selfie via WhatsApp to my Ammachi (Grandmother). At my school, I immediately began Grade 11, when I was formally enrolled in Computer Science as a subject. My instructor was highly motivating. She inspired me to consider a career in computer science.
            <br><br>Later that year, when covid was still around, one of my dad's close friends offered me the chance to work as an intern there. I was first afraid, but he assured me not to worry since he would show me what needed to be done. He and I would stay up late to master the language we built our apps in because I was a touch behind my peers and needed to catch up Later I would go on to build an app with my colleagues which gave me a refreshing idea of how it was like working in the IT sector.
